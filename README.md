# Edabit Challenges

This repository contains multiple files, each handling a different problem. Below are brief instructions on how to run each file:

* Run `node <file_name>` to execute the file.

* Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the file you want to run.

Example:

* `node convert.js` : This will execute the `convert.js` file and display the output in the terminal.

* Repeat the same process for other files in the directory.
